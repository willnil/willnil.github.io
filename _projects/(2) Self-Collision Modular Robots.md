# Self-Collision Checking and Avoidance of Modular Robots

The robot should be able to detect self-collision and execute appropriate measures to prevent it. During this practical project, our team worked with path planning, simulation, robot control team to develop online collision detection algorithms for the modular robots. We also implemented some collision avoidance strategies in scenarios where automatic path planning is performed.
